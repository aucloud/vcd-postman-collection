## Contributing

If you are editing the markdown files in this repo, the use of `mdformat` is mandatory to enforce a consistent style and minimise formatting errors.

`mdformat` is run with `pre-commit`

- Install the pre-commit locally with `make pre-commit-install`
- Force `mdformat` to run with `make mdformat`
  - `mdformat` pre-commit fails if it reformats files. If it fails run it again. If fails twice read the error message :/
